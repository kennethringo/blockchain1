Blockchain app 1 - how to run

to run all tests: npm run test
to run dev-test: npm run dev-test
to start p2p-server: npm start
to start p2p-server as dev: npm run dev
 
note: postman usage starts in section 4

* in terminal $npm run dev (for main server instance)
* start up Postman application on Mac
* run commands in Postman using endpoints specified in app/index.js ie
    * specify get request at: localhost:3001/blocks
    * then if you want to mine/add new block to chain post localhost:3001/mine
	select JSON as body then
	{
		“data” : “foo”
	}
	hit enter

When connecting a new server make sure to use the P2P_PORT as PEER connection ie
	PEERS=ws://localhost:5001 as opposed to PEERS=ws://localhost:3001 (here 3001 is HTTP_PORT)
In terminal $ HTTP_PORT=3002 P2P_PORT=5002 PEERS=ws://localhost:5001 npm run dev
